            Semester Long Events
        </h1>
        Semester long events (also known as continuous event) belong to projects that last for a whole <br/>
        semester in length. For non-semester long events a volunteer can sign up for a single event. <br/>
        For semester long events a volunteer must sign up for the project for a whole semester and <br/>
        attend all of the events for that semester-long project.<br/>
        <br/>
        If an event is not marked as semester-long then it is a regular one time event signup.<br/>
